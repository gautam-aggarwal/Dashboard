# Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is a dashboard I built using React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It’s designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for visualizing and managing data effectively.

## My Approach
### 1. **Planning**
   - I started by defining the objectives and requirements for the project.
   - I outlined the features I wanted to include, like dynamic charts, user interaction, and responsiveness.
   - Created rough wireframes to map out the layout and overall structure of the dashboard.

### 2. **Development**
   - Used **React.js** to create reusable components, which helped keep the code organized and manageable.
   - Focused on styling with **CSS** to ensure the application is responsive and visually appealing.

### 3. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Tested thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs.
   - Made sure the dashboard worked smoothly on different browsers and devices.

## Challenges I Faced
### 1. **Component Structure**
   - **Problem:** Structuring the components in a way that avoids redundancy and ensures scalability.
   - **Solution:** I designed a hierarchical component structure with clear separation of concerns, ensuring that each component had a single responsibility. For example, separate components were created for header, side bar, and user info.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Problem:** Making the dashboard look good on all screen sizes.
   - **Solution:** I used CSS Flexbox/Grid along with media queries to make it responsive.

### 3. **Library Integration**
   - **Problem:** Customizing charting libraries to fit the dashboard’s needs.
   - **Solution:** I spent time going through the official documentation and community resources to make it work.

## Assumptions I Made
- Users will have a basic idea of how to interact with dashboards.
- The dashboard will primarily be used on modern browsers supporting ES6 and above.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautam-aggarwal/Dashboard
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Dashboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Plans
- Adding user authentication and role-based access.
- Introducing real-time data updates with WebSockets.
- Improving accessibility for better usability.
